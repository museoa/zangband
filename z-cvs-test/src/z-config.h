/*
 * OPTION: See the Makefile(s), where several options may be declared.

 * Some popular options include "USE_GCU" (allow use with Unix "curses"),
 * "USE_X11" (allow basic use with Unix X11), "USE_XAW" (allow use with
 * Unix X11 plus the Athena Widget set), and "USE_CAP" (allow use with
 * the "termcap" library, or with hard-coded vt100 terminals).
 *
 * The old "USE_NCU" option has been replaced with "USE_GCU".
 *
 * Several other such options are available for non-unix machines,
 * such as "MACINTOSH", "WINDOWS", "USE_IBM", "USE_EMX".
 *
 * You may also need to specify the "system", using defines such as
 * "SOLARIS" (for Solaris), etc, see "h-config.h" for more info.
