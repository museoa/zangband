<H1>Why AngbandTk?</H1>

Angband is a great game, but somewhat difficult for new users to get into
due to its terminal-based design. AngbandTk adds a graphical interface to
Angband using the Tk toolkit, for a more usable (I hope) event-driven
gaming experience.

<H1>Why Tcl/Tk?</H1>

I started using Tcl in the summer of 97 and enjoyed the fact it let me write
graphical applications without knowing anything about Windows programming.
As I began writing a graphical interface for Angband, I realized that
using Tcl should provide AngbandTk with a great deal of portability to other
systems, which is one of Angband's great strengths.
<P>
The mass of user interface code is written entirely in Tcl, using the Tk
toolkit. I feel the ability to customize the game without recompilation is a
huge plus, and imagine seeing a lot of creativity from others as they change
the interface to suit their tastes.
<P>
