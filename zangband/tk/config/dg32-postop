# Double-plus hack -- Each time the character enters a dungeon level,
# we randomly select some feature icons to use from David E. Gervais' huge
# collection (via the <Dungeon-enter> quasi-event). Since that event isn't
# generated until after the windows are displayed for the first time, we
# want to make sure the icons are chosen already so the user doesn't see
# them change from whatever was saved in dg32-assign.
