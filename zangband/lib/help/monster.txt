=== Zangband Monsters ===

There are hundreds of different creatures in Zangband each of which
poses a unique challenge to the adventurer. As you progress deeper into
the dungeon, the creatures will become progressively more difficult to
defeat.

=== Monster Symbols ===

Many monsters have the same letter symbol and sometimes color on the
screen. The exact species or type of creature can be discovered by
'l'ooking at it (see commdesc.txt#Looking [1]).

Note that some monsters disguise themselves by assuming the shape (ie.
symbol) of common objects found in the dungeon. These include the
|, ), ?, !, &, $ and * symbols.


***** <MonsterColors>
=== Monster Colors ===

You can often determine some information about a monster based solely
on the color it is described as having, like 'a White Dragon'. In
general, 'White' monsters are cold-based, 'Red' are fire-based, 'Blue'
are electrical, 'Black' are acidic, and 'Green' are poisonous and a
'Multi-Hued' monster is all of these. By being cold-based, we mean that
the monster has either melee, magical or breath attacks that are cold
based.

Unfortunately this rule is applied somewhat inconsistently and there
are several notable exceptions so don't be surprised. If that 'Green'
monster spits acid at you. Note that this rule cannot be applied to the
actual color a creature is displayed as but only to a color in its
name.

Other color and attack-type relationships are 'Bronze' and confusion
and 'Gold' and sound. Over time the inconsistencies referred to above
will probably get cleaned up.


***** <MonsterMemory>
=== Monster Memories ===

Because there are so many monsters and because often different monsters
share similar colors and symbols, it is very difficult to keep track of
the capabilities of various creatures. Luckily, Zangband automatically
keeps track of your experiences with a particular creature.
 
This feature is called the monster memory. Your monster memory recalls
the particular attacks of each creature (whether or not technically a
monster) which you have suffered, as well as recalling if you have
observed them to multiply or move erratically, or drop treasure, etc.
Similary if you attack a creature with a magical attack and it resists,
that fact is noted. 

If you have killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered enough
attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide you with
information not otherwise available, such as a armor class or hit dice.
These are not explained, but may be useful to give the relative danger
of each creature.
 
Your monster memory may be accessed by pressing '/' and then entering
the symbol you wish to research. Each monster with that symbol of which
you have some knowledge will displayed in turn beginning with the
deepest. Alternatively, you may enter targetting mode by pressing '*'
and, with the curser over the creature in question, press 'r' to
recall details.

The best feature about your monster memory is that it can be passed on
to a new character even after you die by means of a reduced save file.
Simply use your old savefile as the base for creating your new
character.
