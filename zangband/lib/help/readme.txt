=== Notes on Zangband Documentation ===

This file sets out basic information regarding the official Zangband
documentation package produced by the Zangband DevTeam. 


--- Documentation Packages ---

There are currently two documentation packages planned. The basic
package will include non-spolier information necessary for a new player
to learn all he needs to know about playing Zangband and will be
included in all official Zangband source and binary releases. The
extended package will included additional spoiler files and will be
available for download separately. Care will be taken to ensure that
the two packages merge together properly.


--- Available Formats ---

The Zangband documentation packages will be made available in three
formats for download, plain text, html and .chm (for windows users).
The plain text version will run from the in-game '?' command. The html
version will be placed on the web and will be made available for
download to allow local browsing. The *.chm file is a windows specific
format which allows adaption of html documentation packages to be used
in windows helpfiles. It introduces full text searching and many other
nice features.


--- Reporting Errors / Suggestions for Improvement ---

While every effort will be taken to ensure that the documentation
packages are accurate and up to date, it is innevitable that some
errors will be made. If you find an error or have a suggestion to
improve documentation, please post your report or idea to the Zangband
Development list by mailing to zangband@onelist.com. Alternatively, you
may post your report or idea to the rec.games.roguelike.angband.
