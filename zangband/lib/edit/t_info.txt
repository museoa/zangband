# === Understanding t_info.txt ===

# N: serial number : & field name~
# G: symbol : color
# W: priority : type : counter inital value 
# I: flag | flag | flag
# D: Data[8] 
# F: location,function | location,function | location,function


# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. The '&' and '~' symbols are use to
# include articles and pluralization as necessary to ensure
# grammatical correctness in descriptions.

# 'G' is for graphics - symbol and color. There are 16 colors, as
# follows:

# D - Black        w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Dark Gray    W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# 'W' describes extra information about the field.  Priority decides
# which field is visually "on top".  Type is a number which describes
# whether the field is a trap, door, building, magic wall etc.
# Counter initial value is used for timed effects / effects with counters.

# 'I' is a set 'info' flags describing the type of field.  These are mostly
# used for "quick" recall of information.  (Most other things probably can
# be stored in the data[] array if required.)

# 'D' 8 bytes of data for the field.  How this is used depends on the
# functions called in the 'F' section below.

# 'F' The list of functions used by the field.  "Location" refurs to the
# entry in the action[] array.  See defines.h for the various action types.
# Note the lack of space between the two parts.  The comma is the seperator.
