This is a document file listing the changes in Zangband (compared to
the standard Angband 2.8.1.) No long explanations, just a list. See
code for details. In reversed chronological order (more or less):

Changes in Zangband 2.7.5pre1:

2005-06-04 14:26  rr9

	* src/zborg2.c: The borg didn't correctly reset his goal when
	entering a new level.

2005-06-04 14:25  rr9

	* src/zbmagic2.c: The borg didn't predict the power from the "sleep
	nearby monsters" artifact activation correctly.

2005-06-01 14:49  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg8.c, zborg9.c: The
	borg often forgot to revisit shops.

2005-05-30 16:01  siemelink

	* src/: externs.h, object2.c, store.c: There was a bug in the
	shopping code that created duplicated items because the sold item
	was not taken away from the equipment.	I fixed this bug by copying
	the drop_object code that handles droppng an equipped item that was
	missing in the shopping code.

2005-05-26 12:54  siemelink

	* src/zborg7.c: The borg can now *identify* an item that has
	special or terrible as pseudo-id but that has not yet been
	identified.

2005-05-26 12:51  siemelink

	* src/zborg2.c: The borg parses pet messages successfully

2005-05-18 12:21  siemelink

	* src/wizard1.c: I Synchronized the full monster spoilers with the
	monster knowledge routine.  Fixed the object description spoiler
	that was showing unknown items as unknowns.

2005-05-18 12:17  siemelink

	* src/object1.c: If you examine a weapon that is to heavy for you
	you'll get a line saying just that.  This comes in handy when you
	want to buy a new weapon in the shop.

2005-05-16 14:26  rr9

	* src/run.c: Improved the running code so that it stops at corridor
	entrances when running alongside the wall of a room.

2005-05-15 21:28  rr9

	* src/makefile.std: - Provided an "osx-dist" Makefile target to
	build a *.dmg disk image containing ZAngband.  - Cleaned up the OS
	X part of the Makefile a bit.

2005-05-15 16:13  rr9

	expects user and group separated by a colon instead of a period.

2005-05-15 15:55  rr9

	* src/makefile.std: Added an "osx-install-tiles" Makefile target.
	An archive with the Mac-tiles can be found at:

	c-275.zip

2005-05-15 15:26  rr9

	makefile.std, util.c: Ported the basic Angband OS X code to
	ZAngband.

2005-05-15 13:15  rr9

	* src/h-config.h: Allow the definition of PRIVATE_USER_PATH to be
	overwritten.

2005-05-15 12:55  rr9

	strcat() that check the buffer size.

2005-05-15 12:28  rr9

	* src/makefile.std: Make is picky about tabulators and spaces. 
	Don't use tabs where spaces should be.

2005-05-14 17:41  siemelink

	* src/maid-grf.c: The last patch broke more things than it fixed,
	so undo it.

2005-05-14 16:19  rr9

	* src/maid-grf.c: Added a workaround for a crash in bigscreen mode.

2005-05-14 15:46  rr9

	* src/: cmd3.c, files.c: Fixed two compiler warnings.

2005-05-09 15:32  siemelink

2005-05-02 10:44  siemelink

	* src/files.c: Fix resizing when there is a menu on the screen.

	* src/zborg2.c: Repair the borg recognizing uniques.

2005-05-02 09:32  siemelink

	* src/zborg8.c: Allow the borg to search twitchingly only in
	dungeons.  Otherwise it burns its phase and teleport scrolls.

2005-04-28 12:11  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: Fix that the borg leaves the vanilla town for the
	dungeon Made the header of borg_flow_spread easier to use.

2005-04-28 12:08  siemelink

	* src/zborg7.c: Remove old comment

2005-04-28 11:51  siemelink

	* src/zborg3.c: Enble borg use of artifact phase door.

2005-04-01 12:52  siemelink

	* src/zborg7.c: The borg can now use artifact activation and hobbit
	racial power to eat.

2005-02-12 22:59  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: Oops, !vanilla should have been vanilla

2005-02-12 22:45  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: And avoid the borg trying to wait inside the
	building.

2005-02-12 22:39  siemelink

	* src/: zborg6.c, zborg8.c: Have the borg check his money before
	going to an inn to wait out the night

2005-02-12 22:35  siemelink

	* src/zborg8.c: Have the borg check his money before using an inn

2005-02-12 22:21  siemelink

	* src/: zborg2.c, zborg6.c, zborg9.c: tweaks to borg_status window,
	borg_find_town and that Line of Sight that I left in comments.

2005-02-03 22:36  siemelink

	* lib/edit/k_info.txt, src/zborg1.c, src/zborg1.h, src/zborg2.c,
	src/zborg4.c, src/zborg6.c, src/zborg6.h, src/zborg7.c,
	src/zborg8.c, src/zborg9.c: What a few days without the internet
	can do:
	
	There are some procedures that call borg_power() to swap items. 
	Borg_power has as a side effect that it resets bp_ptr.	But these
	procs would sometimes leave bp_ptr inconsistent with the unswapped
	state.	These procedures now call borg_power at the end to make
	sure that bp_ptr is consistent with reality.  The existing
	inconsistency was causing an error with borg_restock and a
	wilderness loop.  Tried to fix another wilderness loop.  There was
	a funny calculation to determine the best shop in town.  But as the
	borg visits all the shops anyway I changed the best shop into the
	closest, unvisited shop.  Put in some more GOAL_NONEs The previous
	entry trying to fix message handling for monks was incorrect as it
	missed al the uniques if they were hit by some fancy monk move.  I
	fixed it by first testing the message for a suffix.  I tried to fix
	the dungeon loop where the borg would hover close to a non-moving
	monster just around the corner.  I put in another line of sight
	check to improve on this.  There was a wilderness loop where the
	borg would reach a town but leave it right away for some unexplored
	wilderness.  This won't happen anymore because now the borg will
	head for a shop when it realizes that it reached the town.

2005-01-26 10:58  siemelink

	* src/zborg7.c: Allow the borg to light up, detect traps and
	monsters in the wilderness

2005-01-26 10:02  siemelink

	* src/: zborg3.c, zborg7.c: Prevent the borg from wearing crap
	items like an amulet of teleportation

2005-01-20 21:38  siemelink

	* src/: externs.h, object1.c, object2.c: Add wraparound for
	examining objects.  Now the tail end of your object description
	won't fall off.

2005-01-20 14:34  siemelink

	* src/: zborg3.c, zborg6.c: The borg no longer stops when as a
	Half_giant it wanted to eat rock

2005-01-19 13:05  siemelink

	* src/: cave.c, externs.h, run.c: If the player is runnig he'll
	stop when he's is next to a shop entrance.

2005-01-19 12:49  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg6.c, zborg6.h: Prevent the borg from
	eating a cure poison when the borg is full or gorged (unless the
	borg has three hp or less)

2005-01-19 11:51  siemelink

	* src/zborg2.c: Fixed parsing of hit-messages with a suffix Prevent
	borg_add_town to add towns called Bottom, lev or 50 ft

2005-01-19 09:33  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.h, zborg5.c, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg8.c, zborg9.c:
	Another attempt to prevent lifelock for borgs in the wilderness

2004-11-26 17:46  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg2.h, zborg9.c: Fiddle with
	borg_add_dungeon

2004-11-25 22:43  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.c, zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg2.h, zborg6.c, zborg6.h,
	zborg9.c: Prevent the borg from using towns called Bottom and 100
	ft.  Hack the borg_map_reader a bit further so the borg knwos the
	correct recall_depth.  Make the borg look for more towns in the
	wilderness depending on its level.  Prevent the borg from waiting
	out the night while on a swamp.  If the borg is looking for an inn
	it might as well remember it with goal_shop.  I rewrote the
	wilderness explorer so that the borg will explore a dark spot on
	the map by not going there all the way but just far enough. 
	Prevented another bouncing borg, with shops this time.

2004-11-22 10:53  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg2.c, zborg5.c, zborg6.c, zborg7.c,
	zborg8.c, zborg9.c: Fix a bouncing borg in the wilderness.  Borgs
	that have IM_POISON do not need to carry cure poisons anymore The
	wilderness map reader now includes wilderness dungeons.  I rewrote
	borg_leave_level

2004-11-20 21:19  siemelink

	* src/zborg9.c: Aha, I forgot to press save.

2004-11-20 21:16  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.c, zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg3.c, zborg5.c, zborg6.c,
	zborg6.h, zborg7.c, zborg9.c: I removed the last of the
	borg_notes_fmt I made an attempt to get rid of the bouncing borg
	(with telepathy) problem where it would flow to a monster,
	accidentally erase it, do something new, see the monster, flow to a
	it, erase it....  The borg no longer rests close to some mana
	draining monster I integrated the two routines that made the borg
	pick a dungeon The borg now realizes that a immunity also
	represents the relevant resistance.  The status window noe also
	displays immunities to poison, light and dark.

2004-11-19 15:21  siemelink

	* src/dungeon.c: If you were not hurt by shallow swamp in the
	wilderness you still got the -The plants poison you- message.  No
	longer.

2004-11-19 09:41  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.c, zborg1.h, zborg6.c: Reduce the compile size by
	changing some static arrays used by the borg to be dynamically
	allocated.

2004-11-19 09:22  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: Fix the livelock that occurred when the borg was
	picking up items on painful feats.

2004-11-19 08:59  siemelink

	* src/: zborg6.c, zborg8.c: Fix some omissions for the borg
	wilderness handling

2004-11-18 12:55  siemelink

	* src/run.c: Allow players with levitation to continue running
	(ahem) over terrains that would hurt them without levitation.  Now
	the player isn't stopped everytime he runs (flies) next to swamp or
	acid either.

2004-11-18 12:46  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg1.c, zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg2.h,
	zborg3.c, zborg4.c, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg7.c, zborg8.c,
	zborg9.c: Prevent frequent crash.  Further improvements to
	wilderness handling:  The borg goes to an inn when it is dark, to a
	dungeon of the right depth compared to its equipment and to (all)
	the known towns to go shopping.

2004-10-30 22:51  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg2.h, zborg3.c,
	zborg4.c, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg8.c, zborg9.c: Tweaks to the
	flow code for the wilderness changed a light beam radius test from
	<= to < Prevent the borg from wearing weapons of Morgul, it used to
	like them because of the see invisible.

2004-10-27 10:18  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg1.h, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg8.c: If the
	borg is standing on some painful terrain feature it now can get
	off.

2004-10-26 22:12  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg1.c, zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg3.c,
	zborg3.h, zborg5.c, zborg5.h, zborg6.c, zborg6.h, zborg7.c,
	zborg8.c, zborg9.c: I have introduced the concept of multiple
	dungeons to the borg.  The borg now keeps track of the location and
	depth of the dungeons it has seen.  When about to Recall into a
	dungeon it will first pick a dungeon with the correct depth.  When
	it is dark the borg will head for the closest Inn to wait out the
	night.	I added another borg command ^z9:  The list of dungeons.

2004-10-20 22:43  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: Enable the borg to explore the wilderness.  If the
	borg is bored at a town or far away from dungeons it will locate
	the closest unexplored spot on the map and head in that direction.

2004-10-20 22:40  siemelink

	* src/spells3.c: Aha, here was that boundary fix for the map maker.

2004-10-20 22:38  siemelink

	* src/zborg9.c: Force the borg to release it flow target when that
	target is a jungle.

2004-10-20 22:36  siemelink

	* src/: scores.c, zborg8.c: Fix faulty boundary for the map maker.

2004-10-19 10:49  siemelink

	* src/: externs.h, object1.c, object2.c, store.c: Yet another fix
	to the *id* handling.  I accidentally left out its use in the
	shops.	Maybe this time it is ready.

2004-10-19 10:47  siemelink

	* src/zborg4.c: remove unused variable.

2004-10-19 10:46  siemelink

	* src/: cmd3.c, defines.h, load.c, monster1.c, save.c: Fix some
	library issues.  1:  You couldn't find a researched monster in the
	monster memory if you had never seen it before.  2:  If you
	research a monster that you have researched before it is now for
	free.  3:  There were differences between what you'd see in the
	library and the monster memory, if the monster had never been
	killed.  I fixed this by introducing a new monster flag,
	RF6_LIBRARY.  If set then a monster description will include those
	details.  To do this properly r_ptr->r_flags[6] has to be saved,
	which it wasn't.  I found that a previous change of mine (finding
	out about swimming monsters) also needed this to be saved.   I
	hadn't realize this until now.	So I've upped SAVEFILE_VERSION,
	added a wr32b in save.c and an	if (sf_version > 51) rd32b in
	load.c.  I think I did that right, please correct me if I am wrong.
	
	Willem.

2004-10-17 22:28  siemelink

	* src/zborg8.c: Fix the borg use of the healer building.

2004-10-17 22:28  siemelink

	* src/: object1.c, object2.c: Add the pack letter when you are
	examining an object.

2004-10-17 22:26  siemelink

	* lib/edit/t_info.txt: Add a message to the healing building when
	all your stats are tiptop.

2004-10-17 21:38  siemelink

	* src/zborg3.c: Try to prevent a crash noticed by mnbv

2004-10-17 21:37  siemelink

	* src/zborg9.c: Fix omission of "%s", in a prtf

2004-10-15 19:39  siemelink

	* src/zborg5.c: increase the penalty for aggravate monsters.  The
	borg would wield a weapon of morgul otherwise.

2004-10-15 18:33  siemelink

	* src/: zborg1.h, zborg2.c, zborg4.c, zborg8.c, zborg9.c: Get the
	borg to understand buildings that are not shops.  The borg can	now
	use the weaponmaster, the two magesmiths, the casino, the
	zymurgist, the map maker, the inn, the healer, the magetowers and
	the castles.  Just for the library and the mutatalist I can't think
	of a way for the borg to use them advantageously.

2004-10-15 17:51  siemelink

	* src/zborg7.c: Yet another rewrite of the enchant weaopn and
	armour routines.  This the aim was to let the borg always read the
	scroll and cast spells onyl for a while.  There were put together
	and that prevented the borg from reading scrolls when it is in the
	wilderness for a long time.

2004-10-15 17:48  siemelink

	* src/zbmagic1.c: prevent the borg from using teleport level in
	town/wilderness because in the wilderness there usually is no
	dungeon beneath.

2004-10-14 22:21  siemelink

	* src/zborg6.c: Undo change to wait for recharging rods.  It is
	necessary for them to be charging in the first place.

2004-10-14 22:20  siemelink

	* src/zborg3.c: The racial power could be used when the borg does
	not have enough hitpoints....

2004-10-14 00:00  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg3.c, zborg3.h, zborg4.c, zborg6.c,
	zborg7.c: Add some code for the borg to handle the branding of
	bolts with the Crossbow of Brand.  Add a hack for the borg to
	handle the second racial powers of Amberites and Ghouls.

2004-10-12 11:56  siemelink

	* src/bldg.c: If you are a monk you can now see your attacks listed
	at the weaponmasters.

2004-10-12 11:55  siemelink

	* src/wizard2.c: If you create money in wizard mode the maximum is
	now a bit less so it won't look odd in the shops on the gold
	remaining line.  But don't worry, 99999999 is still plenty.

2004-10-12 11:53  siemelink

	* lib/edit/k_info.txt: Give all the armours an article (a/an). 
	They were the only objects without them.

2004-10-11 23:46  siemelink

	* lib/edit/t_info.txt, src/bldg.c, src/object1.c: Smoothen the use
	of special buildings.

2004-10-11 14:17  siemelink

	* lib/edit/k_info.txt, src/cmd6.c, src/externs.h, src/l-spell.pkg,
	src/object2.c, src/script.c, src/spells3.c: Attempt to have a
	correct message after identifying an object.  The message often
	contains the wrong letter for the identified object or the id
	scroll.  This happens because of the sorting and combining which is
	done after the message generation.  So I moved the sorting and
	combining forward.  This solution is not perfect, there are some
	obscure possibilities that still generate an incorrect message. 
	(When by reading a scroll of identify you combine two piles of
	scrolls of identify) To keep everything consistent I had to hack a
	bit too.  So if my hacks are too monstrous please tell me how to
	make it better.

2004-10-11 14:05  siemelink

	* src/object1.c: That tweak of examining was no good.  Back to
	normal.

2004-10-11 12:19  siemelink

	* src/: defines.h, l-ui.pkg: Complete changes to window options
	screen.

2004-10-11 12:16  siemelink

	* src/object1.c: Tweak *identify*

2004-10-11 12:13  siemelink

	* lib/edit/k_info.txt: Fix a double d: entry that wasn't to be.

2004-10-07 22:24  siemelink

	* lib/edit/t_info.txt: Correctly fix the compact runes with bOr
	instead of +

2004-10-07 22:23  siemelink

	* src/zborg4.c: Tweak borg appreciation of TY_curse

2004-10-06 23:35  siemelink

	* src/zborg9.c: Make sure that the borg ignores the new options
	emergency_stop

2004-10-06 23:34  siemelink

	* src/: cmd4.c, defines.h, effects.c, externs.h, tables.c: Add a
	#define WINDOW_CHOICE_MAX which contains the number of different
	widows you can have.  Make the window submenu use it.  Add a new
	option emergency_stop.	If your hitpoints get low this option will
	discard all your input until you press a 'c' to continue.  I've
	played with this option and I found that it cut down on the number
	of careless deaths by at least 50%.

2004-10-06 22:55  siemelink

	* lib/edit/t_info.txt: compact runes didn't work because this
	cannot be parsed.  PROJECT_HIDE | PROJECT_JUMP.  Apparently the |
	is not in lua.	I don't know what is but in this case a + fixes the
	problem.

2004-10-06 22:53  siemelink

	* lib/help/spoiler.hlp: Replace reference to web page that no
	longer exists with a how to generate the spoilers yourself.

2004-10-06 22:52  siemelink

	* lib/edit/e_info.txt, src/dungeon.c: Attempt to prevent bad ego
	items from showing up as {good} or {excellent}

2004-10-06 22:36  siemelink

	* lib/edit/k_info.txt: Fix the script for staff of slowness

2004-10-06 22:35  siemelink

	* src/: zborg5.c, zborg7.c, zborg8.c: Minor tweaks.

2004-10-04 22:25  siemelink

	* src/: zbmagic1.c, zborg3.c, zborg3.h, zborg4.c, zborg5.c,
	zborg7.c: Add the use of BORG_ACT_* to the power calculations. 
	Some items are no longer left at home: Enchant scrolls and resis
	heat/cold potions.

2004-09-27 22:18  siemelink

	* src/: artifact.c, birth.c, defines.h, object2.c, scores.c:
	Restrict the usage of OB_STOREB to inside the shops only.  Once you
	buy an item the flag goes away.  Introduce OB_NO_EXP that keeps
	track of items that shouldn't be scored because they came from a
	shop.  This is to make shopbought items show their flavor. 
	Previously, you'd have a shopbought potion of poison and you could
	not tell its flavor.  This I found weird because the player has the
	potion right there in his pack so surely he can see if the flavor
	is polka-dot.

2004-09-27 11:27  siemelink

	and a fput_str describing what object it was.

2004-09-27 11:19  siemelink

	* src/: flavor.c, wizard2.c: There was a bug where you could find
	out what a potion was by dropping several of them at home.  If you
	would pick it up the home/store code would reveal what is was.	I
	fixed it by testing for the OB_SHOPB flag.  Only with that flag you
	can see an unid'd item completely in a shop.  This warped the
	wizard mode play with object command so I fixed that by giving such
	object a temporary shop flag.

2004-09-27 10:49  siemelink

	* src/: artifact.c, cmd3.c, externs.h, object1.c, spells3.c,
	store.c: identify_fully_aux returned a bool in case there was
	nothing special.  But the returned bool was always (TRUE).  So I
	replaced the bool with a void and put the nothing special inside
	identify_fully_aux.  I replaced a msgf that stated what you were
	examining with a fput_str to get that item as a header for the
	examination info.  I added that you only need to be aware of an
	object to see its description from k_idx.txt.

2004-09-27 10:43  siemelink

2004-09-17 09:14  siemelink

	* src/zborg8.c: If the home is full the borg will take the item
	away that costs the least, instead of just the negative ones.  When
	attempting to add an item to the home when it is almost full the
	added value must be higher than the item in the home that adds the

	* src/: zborg1.c, zborg3.c, zborg3.h, zborg4.c, zborg5.c, zborg6.c,

	borg_spell_no_reserve for when you know there is no danger and
	theborg should do a reserve mana check.  Use this for identifying

	Prevent a crash when evaluating borg_power_home().  Rewrite

	items that need *id* to make the shop *id* it.	Make the borg
	remember the settings of 11 options that have to be set FALSE. 
	WHen the borg is done the original value is restored.  This is for
	my daughter who likes to explore caves.  She uses easy_open and the

	Removed the broken VERIFY_SAVEFILE option because it didn't work. 
	Removed the VERIFY_TIMESTAMP option because it was trivial to hack

	borg_wearing_cursed and replaced it with bp_ptr->status.cursed The
	borg now counts how many items it has to identify, remove curse or
	whatever.  This way the borg can put items that need *id* at home

	The borg now judges the fail rate for cursed items correctly.  The
	borg may now read a scroll of mundanity The borg now wield/wear
	cursed/heavy cursed or teleport items if the other flags on the

	scores on a page?  I use bigscreen after all.  So I fixed that the

Zangband 2.7.4c
- Fixed a bug that could cause the game to exit with an "Cannot find
  field to delete!" message.

Zangband 2.7.4b
- Lots of borg updates including:
  The borg can use ego items which are not *id*'d.
  The borg is more intelligent with light sources, and with
  spells that produce light.
  The borg now discards more 'boring' items without bothering
  to identify them.
  The borg uses various detection types in a better order.
  Major changes to the borg defence code.
  The borg will *id* rings of lordly protection.
  The floor can now be displayed with ^zg
  The borg will use rods/wands of disarming.
  Stopped the borg from collecting rods of pesticide once it
  has reached lvl 25.
  Added mindcrafters and high_mage as classes that want to
  reach 0% failure rates.
  Fixed calculation of borg armour class.
  Added some code that if the borg has no light but still can
  cast light_area then he should light area anytime he is next
  to a dark spot.
  Rewrote the recharging routine to include {empty} wands and
  staffs.
- Fixed the release so that spell.lua isn't left out.
- Fixed script for speed, poison and salt water potions.
- Fixed loading of savefiles with 'out of bounds' wilderness
  blocks.
- Changed build system to differentiate compile from link in
  sanitized make output.
- Allow post-release versions, like this 'b' version to work
  with the build system.
- Prevent message quest targets being homes.
- Added more diagnostics to the 'test fields' debug command.
- Fix bug in the fields code which was corrupting squares
  with multiple traps/corpses on them.
- Make the output from doing '/*' shorter, so it wasn't
  truncated.
- Allow browsing of any spellbook, since examining them will
  tell you what's inside anyway.
- Made uniques killed list in colour.
- Made known objects list in colour.
- Made town list show store/building attr/chars.
- Fixed crash in overhead map caused by jumping between levels.
- Fixed bug in monster AI found by valgrind.
- Fixed glitch in reset recall prompt.
- Fixed timeout of esp.
- Fixed wipe_o_list() so that objects in stores are deleted
  instead of slowly filling the objects list with dead objects
  as you play more and more games.
- Fixed the alter-stats debug command to use the new internal
  stat limits.
- Fix create_traps() so that it checks for 'naked' grids as
  commented.
- Greatly tweaked wilderness generation so that the closer
  dungeons and quests to the starting town tend to be the least
  dangerous.  The game now tries even harder to place the player
  in an 'easy' spot in the wilderness.
- Fix the mindcrafter out of mana prompt.
- Fix problem with the recursion C->lua->C->lua in
  apply_object_trigger() stomping on the 'current' object, and
  thus causing scripts to fail.
- Fixed wands of haste monster to use the correct function.
- Allowed randarts to have poison immunity.
- Fix shallow swamps so they work properly, and can poison again.
- Fix poison counter code so that poison resistance reduces
  the amount added appropriately.  If you have a 'double' resist
  (timed + normal), then the counter doesn't get incremented.
- Pruned out a huge number of functions from the API exported to
  lua.  This should improve compilation time.
- Added an extra option 'check_tranaction' so the user can decide
  if they want to be prompted for buying/selling items in stores.
- Added price to item list so you can now shop with even fewer
  keypresses.
- Fixed inventory damage so double resistance prevents it again.
- Adjusted pricing of ego items and object flags.
- Fixed all uses of get_check() in lua scripts.
- Changed the tolua utility to generate smaller wrapper .c files
  by using macros for common operations.
- Fix typo in 'fund a lost relic'.

 
Zangband 2.7.4
- Moved the lua scripts for objects into k_info.txt instead of
  having them in object.lua  Object scripts are saved in the
  savefile so add-ons will continue to work in new versions of
  the original game.
- Changed object activations to use lua instead of C.
- Artifact and Ego item activations are now handled inline as
  lua scripts in a_info.txt and e_info.txt
- Fix the large scale wilderness map so that the monster camps
  are not examinable like towns are.
- The "frost bolt" randart activation was doing acid bolt
  by mistake.
- Display "Bottom" when the player is on the last level in a
  dungeon.
- Display some information to show when lights of everburning
  are "empty".
- Fix the booze potion effect in the wilderness.
- Huge number of borg fixes from Willem Siemelink.  The borg is
  now much smarter with spells and objects.  The borg no
  longer gets confused in stores, and many borg 'loops' have
  been fixed.
  The borg now uses id / *id* again. 
  The borg can now activate rings, rods, wands etc.
  The borg enchants items better.
  Improve the borg ^z commands displays.
  The borg uses emergency spell casting more intelligently.
  The borg understands more object flags.
  The borg stores spell books it can't use yet in its home.
- The game now makes wooden bridges over the rivers in the
  wilderness.
- Changed the effects of the 'strange luck' flag to make them
  more interesting.
- Give monsters a fighting chance to resist protection at low
  levels.
- Make having a chaos patron reduce spell mana costs for chaos
  spells.  Increase chaos-warriors' mana costs to compensate.
- Chaos-warriors can draw extra power from a chaotic weapon.
- A Holy Avenger weapon gives a paladin a saving throw boost.
- Change how saving throws are calculated. Wisdom has a larger
  effect, all classes have a higher maximum saving throw (at
  least 88%), and saving throw difficulty is modified by monster
  level in most cases.
- Change the mana/int progression to advance slightly faster but
  top out at a lower value. Add a new flag, TR1_SP, and an item
  to provide it.  Added this flag to the crown of the magi.
- Added a new item: amulet of luck.
- Added castles in the towns that can give you quests to do.
  Large castles give more difficult and rewarding quests
  than small castles.
- Removed the old dungeon quests to kill n monsters of a given
  type.  Replacing them are a group of out of depth monsters
  on the level plus a good item to find.  You may also take
  bounty quests from a castle if you want. 
- Fixed font selection in the gtk port.
- Fix arrows of explosion to only explode if they hit.
- Fix various crashes in the monster AI.
- Fixed stacking of torches bought from the store.
- Correctly set BASE_TK_DIR to the value specified by
  --with-tkdir=foo.
- Updated the tk port so it compiles with version 8.3 again. 
- Fix the tk port so that if it fails to start up
  due to X11 not existing, then the game will try some other port.
- Added RISC-OS port from Antony Sidwell.
- Make gtk the default port, not the tk port, which doesn't
  work very well yet.  (This fixes the screen offset problem.)
- Fixed overflow handling of object and monster lists in
  dungeon building.  This stops the game from crashing when it
  tries to make a new dungeon when the old dungeon has a huge
  number of objects / monsters in it.
- Fix a bug in the store cache that was converting empty stores
  into general shops.
- Changed to a new configure.in build system.  This one should
  be more robust.
- Make the build system default to a less verbose method so that
  warning messages are easier to spot. 
  Use "make V=1" to turn on verbose compilation messages.
- New flag disturb_view to disturb when a new monster becomes
  visible (or nonvisible). This	should stop people from running
  into floating eyes while carrying lanterns.
- Change how monster generation depth is calculated. Now we have
  a target 'rating' and try to generate monsters to match it.
- Add a new build target in makefile.std which allows you to
  cross-compile from linux to windows using mingw. You need
  wine installed, along with the bin-fmt extensions so tolua.exe
  can be executed.
- Turn on the broken ASCII handling workaround on in windows XP.
- Move stormbringer to a_info.txt where it belongs.
- Fixed the annoying beeping in the birth menus.
- Remove obsolete arena level options.  These only appear in
  "city" dungeon types now.
- Fix display of items in store when you learn about one by
  buying it.
- Make sure the quest staircases are not created covered in
  a corpse.
- Fix the character dump due to changes in the 'C' info screens.
- Fix display of deadliness values to use the correct numbers in
  object descriptions.
- After detection, overhead maps need to be redrawn.
- Fix problems with some dungeons that start at level 2.
- Fix monster summoning.  Monsters can be summoned to dungeons
  where they might not normally live.
- Changed a few unpopular monsters.
- Rewrite of the random artifact making code.
- Fix crash when creating random artifacts in town.
- Allow descriptions for artifacts.
- Change the way slays/brands and critical hits work: they add
  to deadliness rather than being a seperate multiplier. This
  makes figuring out how much damage you're doing easier.
- Add more object flavors. Add comments to make it easier to
  tell just how many flavors of each type there are.
- Use mmap() to load *_info.raw, if it's available. This makes
  startup much faster.
- Don't use monte carlo for object depth chart if the exact
  routine is available (in debug mode).
- Make some artifacts more flavorful with new good and bad points.
- Add per-dungeon recall depths.
- Updated the FAQ
- Added some magical macros that allow easy access to the object
  and monster flags.
- Change the sense of the dangerous (y/n) questions so that yes
  is always the safest option.
- Use a smarter method of selecting which buildings to use.
  Rarity now works properly.
- Fix some silly messages given when blind. 
- Fix broken knowledge of doors when you open/close them when blind.
- Fix 'icky' status of the pattern so that it isn't broken by
  stairs.
- Fix out of bounds problems with the light area spell.
- Fix the message you get when taking off equipment
  when you have items the object will stack with in your inventory.
- Fix creation of unremovable enscription created when destroying
  *id'ed* artifacts.
- Fix placement of "price" and "weight" column headers in stores
  and make stores work with bigscreen.
- Turn off the execute script debug command by default.
- Fix poison damage so it works like the other basic resists.
  Swamps (but not thick swamps) will not poison you if you have
  resist poison.
- Changed a few races so that they have immunity to poison, instead
  of just poison resistance.  Gave those races vulnerabilities
  to some elements to counteract the advantage.
- Fix broken interaction between fields and targetting commands.
  Corpses won't interfere with shooting now.
- Make 'channel' rooms less annoying.
- Rubble in the wilderness doesn't yield objects when dug out.
- Add 'entrances' to the wilderness dungeons.  Now you'll have to
  fight your way in.
- Add the auto-more option from angband.
- Make starting in wizard mode be able to prevent death again.
  (Instead of crashing on an assert.)
- Improved the error messages given when lua scripts fail.
- Fix bug in message display when printing strings with embedded
  carriage returns.
- Fix magic mapping to work like it used to.
- Fix bug causing dropped wands to not remember used charges
  properly when recombined.
- Fix out of bounds problem with monster lights when teleporting
  in the wilderness.
- Prevent crash when displaying large piles of items.
- Made scrolls of *remove curse* give a message when successfully used.
- Change monsters killed list under '~' menu to display monsters
  in colour.
- Added a new command in the 'show_file()' screens to 'search again'.
  The highlighted strings now work with the colour escape sequences.
- Prevent monster lights leaking through walls.  Make the lights update
  the map when monsters move.
- Fix crash when using cheat death in the dungeon whilst you are
  poisoned, afraid, blind etc.
- Make wiz_lite() only light the dungeon for one turn.


Zangband 2.7.3:
- Added many new object flags to describe new behaviour.
- Changed the build system to not use automake.  The makefiles
  are recursively included, instead of recursively executed.
  This makes intra-directory dependancies work properly.
- Added auto-detection of the gtk, tk and vcs ports in the
  configure script.
- Fixed a bug in the lua source, MULT_RET was being used before
  it was defined.
- More cleanup of the tk port source.  This still is alpha-level
  quality though.
- Replaced much of the random artifact code.  The changes include:
  Preventing the slow digestion flag from being given to armour.
  Themed artifact types.
  More types of items can be random artifacts, including phials etc.
  The power of randarts depends on the depth you find them.
- Fix problems with redrawing the screen when a racial activation
  kills a monster.
- Tweaked the mutations, adding disadvantages to most "good"
  mutations, and advantages to some of the "bad" ones.  Removed
  the regeneration modifier caused by having too many mutations.
- Fixed a crash on loading corrupt savefiles, when o_max was set
  a the limit.
- Changed the r_info.txt to make groups of monsters appear in
  a logical order in the dungeon.
- Prevent multiple traps from being created on the same square.
  It seems no one likes this "feature".
- Added a few new death messages.
- Added a few new items.  (A ring, two amulets and a sword.)
- Removed player histories from the info screen.
- Added themed dungeons.  These will have differing distributions
  of monsters, objects, rooms, floors and depths.  If you don't
  like the booty in one type of dungeon, try somewhere else.
- Added approximately ten more types of rooms so that the new
  dungeons will look quite different from each other.
- Tweaked item selection so that not quite so many out of depth
  items are made early in the dungeon.
- Shortened the town names.
- Added the dragons from Ingeborg Norden.
- Minor fixups to the borg - it understands traps now.
  (Code from Matt T.)
- Huge cleanups to the lua interface - instead of using set_blah(),
  use inc_blah() or clear_blah().
- Added a "return" flags to some items.  This causes them to
  return to your hand when thrown.
- Thrown weapons stack in your inventory.
- Gave rogues an extra shot with a thrown dagger at level 10.
- Only delay on TERM_XTRA_DELAY when the requested delay is >0.
  This should speed up the Borg a lot on systems that end the
  timeslice of the process when calling "usleep(0)".
- Fixed a problem with resizing the bitmap in the gtk port, when bits
  per pixel and bytes per pixel don't correspond (for example 24 bit
  bitmap, but 4 bytes per pixel).
- Fixed the pattern vortex abuse.
- Fix problem with open/closing doors in the dark/blind.
- Fix problem when there are too many objects on a square to list
  them all.  Just list the first 23.
- Fix bug with selling cursed items to stores causing them to be
  displayed for sale at 0 AU.
- Fix bug with bows causing the STR and DEX bonuses to always apply.
- Prevent the player from buying stacks of weapons / armour.
- Optimised the overhead map and dungeon map term types.  They
  should be much more usable on slow machines.
- Fix object corruption in shooting code with regards to the fired
  ammo being paritally overwritten by a dead monsters loot.
- Fix many bugs where changing the ego type of an item didn't cause
  a pack sort/combine.
- Minor error messages are now immediately displayed in the message
  window.  (bug reported by "Mogami")
- Make sure regions are loaded properly.  Before, we generated everything
  and then copied the loaded savefile over the top.  This screws the
  object, monster and field lists.  We now take care of the creation
  manually - fixing up the refcounts in allocate_block().  This fixes
  the "corrupted savefile" bug where the game was bombing out on
  an assert in object2.c  2.7.3 will load these "broken" savefiles
  with no problems.
- Fix a couple of problems with darkness-causing spells.
- Fixed a crash on displaying graphics on secondary terms in a few
  linux ports.
- Removed autoscum and ironman_rooms options.  The new dungeon-making
  algorithm makes much more interesting dungeons...
- Removed the old "destroy dungeon" code - the new ruined dungeons
  look much better.
- Made multiple dungeons appear in the middle of the wilderness.
  The number on the wilderness main-map is the starting depth of the
  dungeon divided by 10.  (Just like quest difficulties.)
- Add the pet info screen as an option in the pet menu.
- Make the enter key function as 'yes' for yes/no prompts.
- Add description lines for objects, and display them in the
  inspect command.  (Most objects don't have descriptions yet.)
- Make the "save and exit" prompt work better with bigscreen.
- Fix autorepeat bug with menu code.  (Makes the 'n' command work
  again.)
- Glyph of warding works again.
- Fix generation of crossroads in the wilderness.
- Add support for broken Win 2k, which has problems displaying the
  "centered dot" character.  This is from "danceswithcrows@usa.net"
   on rec.games.roguelike.angband.
- Updated the FAQ.
- The DOS version can now be compiled with current releases of the
  Allegro library.
- Apply Bablos's fixes to the amiga port.
- Fix the query-symbol command so that it doesn't leave junk on the
  screen.
- Highlight quest monsters in visible monster list term.
- Fix bounds checking so that rooms next to permanent walls on the
  dungeon boundary get lit properly.
- Attempt to fix the problem where the game generates towns with
  blank spots for stores, when converting from old savefiles.
- Display town names on large scale wilderness map when cursor is on
  the towns.
- Add command to display list of stores for the highlighted town on
  the large scale wilderness map.
- Removed the view_perma_grids option - it didn't do much.
- Arena levels only appear in "city" dungeons.
- Make deep swamp act safer with regards to resist poison.
- Make the borg_cheat_death option work again.

Zangband 2.7.2:
- Made the HAVE_MKSTEMP option on by default for the linux ports.
  If you do not have a library with that function the option can be
  removed.
- Fixed makefile.std so that the BSD ports will compile properly.
- Fixed some dependancy problems in makefile.std in ports that
  add extra files to compile to the source list.
- Added an option to makefile.std to compile without the gtk
  libraries.
- Made the amiga port use the new overhead map interface.  Removed
  the code that changes the graphical tile indecies only in the
  amiga port.  It is trivial to add it in main-ami.c if needed.
- Replaced the Amulet of Adornment with Amulet of Berserk Strength.
- Fixed some monster pluralization issues.
- The game no longer gives away information by displaying the color
  of unknown items in shops.
- Fixed the bug causing wrong prices for items where the base type
  has a bonus/penalty to hit or to ac.
- Fixed some bugs with the quark handling causing object inscriptions
  to be corrupted.
- Acquirement will not give you cursed items.
- Make sure 'good' and 'great' monster drops are not junk.
- Added 'elemental' nests.
- Add missing EASY_KNOW flags to mushroom types.
- The chances for monsters summoned by artifact activations being
  hostile were backwards.
- The depth and xp reward for a few monster types were adjusted.
- Correctly handle changing and saving attr/char prefs on systems
  where 'char' is signed.
- Updated configure.in and the makefile system
- Changed the internal representation of the stats to be linear.
  The only gameplay change is the effects of stat loss from time
  effects.
- The stats are displayed in decimal.
- Don't adjust stats below 3.
- Smoothed out the effects of stat potions.
- There is some randomness applied to the last digit of starting
  characters' stats.
- Added some borg fixes from Lunal (M. Titus).
- Made Rings of See Invisible, Dexterity, Resist Fire and Cold,
  and Ring of the Cat more common.
- Change the nominal depths of many items to match their actual
  drop depths, or in some cases add or change drop entries to match
  the nominal depth.  (This fixes some old bugs caused by the
  dungeon rearrangement in 2.5.x)
- Fixed the bug that caused arrows that miss to disappear and
  corrupt the object arrays.
- Allow magesmiths (weapons) to enchant deadliness a bit higher,
  and display the possible enchantment correctly.
- Fix browse info for many spells to actually match what they do.
- Allow the player to dimension door onto trees.
- Fix bug with drawing the player's light right after sunset.
- Updated the help files.
- Fixed a bug found by Victor Chou where the first item on the
  floor was used when you pressed '-' at the item prompt, even
  when that item was of an incorrect type.
- Fixed the double-free bug for quark strings found by Randy Heit.
- Halve the cost of using the magetowers.
- Fixed a bug causing using a magetower with monster lights on to
  crash the game.
- Changed the price of identify pack and restore all stats building
  options.
- The stone wall spell doesn't affect permanent grids now.
- Fixed the racial and mutation activation menu.
- The *identify* information now uses bigscreen.
- Fixed bug that caused heavily cursed items to be mistakenly shown
  as permanently cursed.
- Scrolls of *Identify* give the message "You have nothing to
  *identify*" if they have nothing to work on.
- Made sure the starting town has a Bazaar.
- Added a hugely altered version of Tim Bakers Tcl/Tk port.  This is
  alpha-quality and most functionality is currently disabled.  It
  will be renabled over time.  Start the game with the -mtnb option
  to try it out.  The code has been changed to be much more portable
  than the original version.  Other angband varients will be able to
  use it if the maid-grf interface is ported over.  This port
  requires tcl/tk version 8.4.0 or higher to compile.
- Changed alot of the string formatting code to be more powerful.
  It now can include colour codes, and calls to specialized
  format functions which can take arbitrary inputs.
- Changed the message and screen display code to use the more powerful
  formatted string input.
- You can use the escape character '$' followed by a letter from A to P 
  in an inscription or player name to make coloured text.
- These escape sequences also work in the help files to allow coloured
  text there as well.
- Moved most of the low-level interface code to a new file: ui.c and
  created a generic menu system in that source file, instead of
  using many copies of virtually the same code throughout the source.
- Simplified the API of the fields code by using vaargs instead of
  pointers to arbitrary structs.
- Updated the Lua source to the 4.0.1 release.
- Changed the terms code so that Term_save() and Term_load() will work
  with an arbitrary number of saved screens, rather than just one.
- Changed the ascii art in the winners crown.
- Removed the old code used to output a matlab .m file used to balance
  the dungeon distribution of monsters.
- Removed many unused options from the borg command screen.
- Removed all users of sprintf() in the main source, and replaced them
  with the safer strnfmt().  Changed all uses of strcat() to strnfcat()
  or strnfmt() to prevent buffer overflows.
- Fixed crashes in the wilderness caused by recursion in trying to
  place monsters on swamp or lava tiles.
- Fixed bug when buying wands from stores when you already have a stack
  with more charges than the number in the store.

  object in a pile was affecting what happened to the ones below it in
  strange ways.
- Prevented artifacts being created with +0 stealth.
- Fixed enormous bug that was corrupting the player inventory when
  loading some savefiles.
- Made spells work on the fake wilderness boundary squares.

  like phantom warriors.

Zangband 2.7.1:
- Split off the graphics-specific code in util.c and moved it into
  maid-grf.c
- Added an overhead map interface into maid-grf.c  This allows
  access to what the player knows about his surroundings in ports
  and in the borg.
- The wilderness size is no longer editable via misc.txt, changing
  it caused savefiles to break.
- Added terrain feature flags to f_info.txt and simplified most
  of the enormous if statements dealing with properties of terrain.
- Added the missing walls to the overhead map priority list.
- Improved the vanilla town so that the stores are distributed
  more evently.
- Added a new option to the query symbol command.  Ctrl-K will list
  the monsters you have killed as this player.
- Added missing do_cmd_rerate() to the lua interface.  Potions of
  new life wont crash the game now.
- Reformatted the recharge building menu.
- Added APW's [Z] borg for 2.4.0  This has been changed an awful lot,
  with nearly all of the low-level code now different.  It uses the
  interface in maid-graf.c as much as possible, instead of going
  through the terms interface.  This means that graphics is
  automatically supported.  It also simplifies things enormously.
  It is still extremely buggy with heaps of missing features.
  eg. It doesn't know about traps, artifacts or the home.
- Improved the pack AI.
- Fixed loading of 2.6.2 savefiles.
- Fixed the chest-inside-a-chest bug.
- Torches given at birth will stack with those found/bought later.
- Remove curse is more powerful, and will uncurse items in the pack
  as well as those being worn.
- Fixed bug where AC and to_hit were much easier to enchant upwards
  than intended.
- You require a large weapon skill in order to get a large number of
  attacks.  This fixes the bug with mage combat ability being too
  large.
- Changed the monster-nest/pit implementation.
- Tweaked white ants a little bit.
- Added a couple new monsters and renamed the second type of giant
  red ant to giant fire ant.
- Updated the emx makefile.
- The ZAngband Borg screensaver should load it's display preferences
  from 'zangband.ini' instead of 'angband.ini'.  (It is disabled at
  the moment though.)
- Optimised update_view() a little bit more.
- Updated the indenter script to more closely match the Angband coding
  style.  Nearly all of the source has passed through this indenter.
- Items that give extra blows work again.
- Made the Ring of Elemental Mastery more powerful, and fixed it so
  it can actually be generated.
- Made elemental attack stat-loss rarer.
- Stores now stock items they buy from the player if there is room.
- Renamed a few stores, and added a Bazaar to the starting town.

  sell anything to the Bazaar in the starting town.
- Fixed the bug that was causing some stores to have no items for sale.
- Add farms to the wilderness.
- Made the more powerful shops much rarer.
- Modify the price formula for enchanted items to be more reasonable
  for very high enchantments.
- Add magetowers which can teleport the player between towns.
- Use a more meaningful character for towns on the wilderness map.
- Display the difficulty of quests on the overhead map.  A '4' means
  a quest equivalent to depth 31-40.
- Fixed the major bug with wilderness quest difficulty.
- The large-scale wilderness map no longer shows area outside the world.
- The distribution of town sizes should be better.

- Added more coloring of the monster memory.
- Fixed the quark code so that objects don't lose their inscriptions
  or artifact/ego names.
- Fixed bug the prevented weapon type effects from taking place.  (Found
  by Zedar)
- Cleaned up the projection code somewhat.  Now missiles will travel
  in much 'straighter-looking' lines if possible.

  monsters causing the shot to hit a wall.
- Changed the low-level object code.  Moved the scanning of lists of
  objects to use an iterator.  Changed how object compaction works.
  Changed things so that there are no statically defined objects.
  This prevents massive memory leaks now that quarks are refcounted.
  Changed the player and store inventories to use linked lists of
  items in k_info.txt  This yields massive simplification of code
  that is duplicated everywhere.  Equipment is still stored as an array.
- Added a couple of weak low-level rings.
- Added message-colour modifying to the '&' command.
- Removed the old Mac port - now main-mac.new is main-mac.c

  in the Angband cvs.
- Replace The Cloak of Benedict with The Filthy Rag of Keri the Humble.
- Removed haggling.
- Removed support for savefiles before version 2.2.x 
- Improved the "standard" makefile alot, and moved many of the other
  makefiles inside it as options.  Use "make -f makefile.std portname"
  to compile with this makefile.  The default port is linux. This
  breaks some ports... but having out of date makefiles was even worse.
- Removed the makefiles of ports that have been merged into makefile.std
- Added a view towns option to the ~ which shows towns you have visited
  and the shops in them (and whether or not the town has stairs)
- If you have toggle_xp on, it displays NEED instead of EXP in the 
  main screen.
- Display some obvious object flags on the 'C'haracter screen.
- Removed two useless flush options, and the flush function works now.
- Lua understands dos path seperators as well as unix ones.  This means
  that cyg-win can now compile the complete game.
- The "Wall of stone" spell no longer can destroy permanent rock.
- Mindcrafter starting potion changed from Restore Mana to Restore
  Wisdom
- Fixed the stat code to work properly again.  The birth process in
  2.7.0 could give way too large of a bonus to certain stats.
- Make a few artifacts deeper and rarer.
- The Oberon quest needs to be level 99, not 98.
- Made the object list menues look better in bigscreen mode, and now
  always show the list of available choices.
- Spell menus always show the list of spells now.
- Made lanterns, torches and oil slightly more common since the phial
  is now deeper in the dungeon.
- Changed the damage dice on whips and clubs.
- Fixed the wrong racial ability description for Half-Trolls.

  Moria: connected stairs, autoroller, and point based generation.
- Removed some old and broken options.
- Made dragon shields and helms rarer.
- Added a function to calculate the distribution of an object in
  the dungeon mathematically, rather than using a Monte Carlo method.
- Disallow floating point in the source.
- Added u64b and s64b types.  This probably breaks most of the
  makefiles / ports. We fall back to "long long" if not using a C99
  compiler.  If your machine definately doesn't have a 64 bit type,
  you can disable the (currently tiny) code in wizard2.c that uses
  it.  Most machines with enough ram to play the game will have a
  compiler with a 64bit type though.
- Monsters with RAND_50 | RAND_25 will only make the 75% check,
  not the 50% and 25% checks as well.
- Fixed the broken "flow by sound" code.
- Fixed the bug with night->day transition in wilderness not resulting
  in map memorisation.
- Wilderness quest object no longer make a sound when created.  They
  can now be enchanted when found.  They can be found in piles.
- Turned on ironman_los permanently.  This probably breaks things.
- Quest descriptions now take into account the depth_in_feet option.
- Attempted to fix use of roguelike keyset with the buildings.
- Added a new option: view_player_colour.  This toggles the colouring
  of the '@' character when you are hurt.

  warnings are generated by the wrapper files now.
- Removed a heap of warnings from the gtk and xaw ports.
- Fixed saving of message colours in the savefile.
- Updated the FAQ with recent common questions.
- Removed the lua wrapper files from the archive, they can be created
  from the makefile.
- Fixed a problem with the autoconf bootstrap method.
- Rangers are better, not worse at hitting monsters hiding in trees.	
- Normal stores can generate good or excellent items again.

  variablity at the start of the game.  This method takes the best
  attributes of both old options.
- Disintegrate affects the new terrains in a smarter way.
- Fixed possible crash in displaying shape-changing monsters.
- Fixed the ironman_los option.
- The ATTR_MULTI flag now takes into account the breaths if the monster
  has any.  This is similar to the code in Oangband.  Several vortices
  and Wyrms now use this flag.
- Changed curse display on the info screen.  A permanent curse is
  displayed like an immunity.
- Added the improved identification patch from RML.
- Split up the cave data type into player and non-player information.
- The memorisation of the map has changed so you remember the terrain
  features.  This prevents you from seeing Umber Hulks approaching
  as they dig their tunnels.
- Added the GRID_SEEN flag from Angband, and optimised the update_view()
  and map_info() routines to use the new information.
- Added a noise-level patch, similar to that in Oangband.  The more
  noisy you are, the further away the monsters will have accurate flow
  information to your location.
- Replaced the underlying wilderness code.  The new code allows quests
  in the wilderness to be made.

  multiple dungeons to be active at once.  They also simplify the code
  for creating towns and quests in the wilderness.

  to the rare stores.
