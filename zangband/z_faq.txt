3. System-specific questions
==========================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 DOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.1 Can I play it in the old ASCII-mode?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can. The old IBM-mode is included in the DOS version and can
be activated with the '-mibm' option. Just run ZAngband with
'ZAngband.exe -mibm' to switch it on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.2 Can I use multiple savefiles?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can. Run ZAngband with the -u<name> option. For example:
'ZAngband.exe -uFred' loads the character called Fred. If no
savefile called 'Fred' is found then a new one is created. To use
another character just run ZAngband with a different name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.3 Why uses the DOS version only 2/3 of the screen?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lower part of the screen is used for displaying two extra windows
with additional information. To activate this feature, press '=' to
access the ZAngband options, then press 'W' to enter the 'Window
Flags' section. Now you can assign various informations to the two
special windows lower part of the screen. Move the cursor to the
'Mirror' column and switch on one of the options with the 'y' key.
A good choice is the 'Display messages' option. Now move to the
'Recall' column and select another option (for example 'Display
inven/equip'). Now press the ESCAPE key two times to leave the
options menu and press Ctrl-R to redraw the screen.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Windows 95/98/NT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.1 How do I run with the numeric keypad in the Windows version?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press the Num-Lock key to switch off Num-Lock mode. Now you should be
able to run when pressing Shift and a key of the numeric keypad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.2 Why do I get an error message when I try to switch on graphics?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'Unusable bitmap palette (255 entries) - Could not initialize
graphics' error means that you tried to use graphics with a desktop
set to 256 colors. Switch to high-color or true-color mode to fix
this problem.

4. Game-play questions
==========================================================================


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Artifacts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.1 What does the artifact xyz do?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the artifacts in ZAngband have some random features, and some
are even completely random, so you have to find out what an artifact
does by yourself. Try reading a scroll of *Identify* (the stars are
important), of use 'Research item' service offered by some buildings
in the towns. Many spellcasting classes get the *Identify* spell at
higher levels. You can also sell artifacts to a store and buy it back
immediatly, but this will cost you a lot of money.
The powers of items that have been *Identified* or bought from stores
can be displayed at any time with the 'I' command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.2 I've found an artifact, but it doesn't show up in the list of
      known artifacts. Is that a bug?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. You've found a 'random artifact'.  These kind of artifacts get
random powers and names, and they are not displayed in the list of
known artifacts. The random artifacts can be found in addition to the
normal ones, and they may even appear in stores from time to time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1.3 I've found an artifact in a store, but I thought artifacts can
never appear there if not sold to the store. Is that a bug?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. The store is selling a 'random artifact'.  See question 4.1.2.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2 Monsters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2.1 I've found a 'Greater Hell Beast' that never does any damage to
      me, and that seems to be immune to my attacks.  What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'Greater Hell Beast' is a joke to scare all the veterans who know
that an "U" is normally a very dangerous greater demon.  It appears
very early and can't hurt you directly, but it's very annoying.
The huge amount of hitpoints and the big armor-class make it nearly
invincible and even if you manage to kill it, it's not worth the
efforts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 Interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1.1 Why can't I see my spells or missiles flying through the air?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First change the "base delay factor" in the options menu to a higher
setting.  A value of 4 (64 milli-seconds) displays the graphical effects
nicely.  Also check that "Flush output before every command" in the
Efficience Options menu is turned on.
